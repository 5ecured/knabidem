# Medibank Coding Challenge

This is a solution to Medibank's coding challenge.

# The first button (show solution)

This is to showcase the original functionality, where all cats must be displayed under male/female. This can be toggled on and off to show/hide. If you would like to focus on the extra functionality (read below) you may hide this section

# The second button (search)

This is to showcase the extra functionality, where there are two user inputs (type of pet and gender) where the app should output a list of pets of the specified type under male/female

### Requirements 1:

- Write some code to consume the json hosted on the above web service.
- Output a list of all the cats in alphabetical order under a heading of the gender of their owner.
- Output must be presentable on a web browser.
- Submissions will only be accepted via GitHub or Bitbucket.

### Requirements 2:
- Add two user inputs - Type of pet and Gender of owner.
- Both the fields are mandatory to do a search.
- Ensure you validate the input before doing the search.
- After entering both the fields, if the user hit Search CTA, the app should output the list of all pets of the specified type listed under the heading of the gender of their owner, which was the second input.
